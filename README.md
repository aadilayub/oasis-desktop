# Oasis-Desktop

Hi. This repository aims to run Oasis in an Electron window. It kind of sucks
but it can probably get better.

## Example

I think

## Install

I'm going to try to build installers, but this is the status quo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fraction/oasis-desktop.git
cd oasis-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

Also, AGPL-3.0 code was reused from both Patchwork and Oasis.
